\section{\label{section:overview}Overview}
   The classic approach to proving a theorem is some really difficult 
   mathematics.  For the theory of relativity, I asked grandpa Al exactly 
   how he proved it.  He gave me a few hints, including some stuff about
   rest mass and big electro-motive force.  I think he is really smart.
\section{Conclusions}
   I conclude that this is a really short thesis.
